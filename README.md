# Note-Keeper App
 A Note taking app, using the Android Architecture Component libraries (Room, ViewModel, LiveData and LifeCycle), a RecyclerView, Java, and SQLite
The data will be stored in an SQLite database and supports insert, read, update and delete operations. For this project I followed the official recommendations from the "Guide to App Architecture"
